## :page_with_curl: About
A Next Level Week is a practical week by Rocketseat with lots of code, challenges and networking. The Rocketseat method is based on three pillars: Practice, Focus and Group.

This repository contains a REST API in Node.js as a back-end, a ReactJS application as a front-end and a mobile app in React Native, all using TypeScript.

This is an Ecoleta application, which is a fictitious marketplace to connect companies that collect organic and inorganic waste as heavy as they need to discard such waste. It was developed during the International Environment Week (01/06/20).

**Node.js**: it is a REST API that uses everything or CRUD gives application, persistence of dice, treats of excellence and that serves dice as much to or front-end as to mobile.

**ReactJS**: This is a web page that cannot be castrated by pigtails.

**React Native**: it is an application in which the user can view the queue points of a specific city, how to enter in contact with companies.
